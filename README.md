# It's ‘Manual’, Not ‘Unskilled’!

A really, _really_ tiny mod for Weather Underground's 2018 game, [Cultist Simulator](https://weatherfactory.biz/cultist-simulator/ "link to game website").

## What?

All it does is change every instance of “Unskilled” in “Unskilled Labour” that I could find in the base game to “Manual Labour”.

That's it. That's the change. That's all there is to it.

Oh, right, and I added compatibility with [dragon](https://steamcommunity.com/id/realDragon11 "link to modder's Steam profile")'s mod, [Ouroboros [Looping Jobs 2023]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823487280 "Link to Steam Workshop item"), because I'm using that mod at that time.

All I've done is tweak the names of the labels. Hopefully I did it correctly, and didn't break anything.

Yeah, I haven't done it with anyone else's looping job mods, yet. Let me know if there's any interest in that, I guess?

## Why?

(deep breath)

Okay. It's just…

All labour requires skill. Even manual labour. You need it to avoid injury, to be more productive, that sort of thing.

It's even in game itself — you develop your [Strength](https://cultistsimulator.fandom.com/wiki/Strength "link to Cultist Simulator Fandom Wiki") Ability so that, in the end, you do your work faster and you avoid the chance of injury. All labour requires skill. It's just some labour, like manual labour, are valued or considered “lesser” than others, and thus is underpaid.

So much of what we consider “civilization” is built up on the backs of manual labour. Just calling it “unskilled” bothered me a _little_ bit, and I did some [reading up on how to mod](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BZiUrSiT8kKvWIEvx5DObThL4HMGVI1CluJR20CWBU0/edit "link to Secret Histories Modding Guide, a community-developed modding reference document on how to mod for Cultist Simulator"), and I tinkered with some JSON files, and… well, here's this janky little mod, made by someone who needed to scratch this _particular_ itch.

I don't even care if this mod remains the way it does, and nothing happens in the base game, or whatever. I made a fix. It kind of works. The sense of relief was _amazing_. I may need to make changes to this mod ever again. I hope so, anyway — it's not my life's work, it's just a small change for one guy at a particular moment in time.

## Anything Else?

No? I guess not. That's it, I guess.

Oh, yeah, this work is licensed with the [Sixth History Community License](https://weatherfactory.biz/sixth-history-community-licence/ "link to license"), mostly because I'm assuming that's the default thing to do, not because I particularly care about who gets to use this or profit from it. Also, it's as-is, I haven't tested it in _any_ capacity except on one save game. I don't even know the first thing to do if something breaks, to be very real with you.

The only art asset I used is in the `profile.png` file, and _that's_ a very mildly tweaked version of [this image](https://svgsilh.com/image/158444.html "link to some SVG image site on the web"), which was released, according to the website, as CC0. Literally took 15 minutes on GIMP, and I only did it because apparently Cultist Simulator mods need a `profile.png` image. Well, there you go.
